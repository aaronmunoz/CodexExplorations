# Active Context

The repository is configured as a TypeScript monorepo for Codex experimentation. Current focus is the minimal roguelike deck‑builder package:

1. Establish the memory bank with core documents.
2. Outline the MVP milestones.

## MVP Milestones
1. **CLI Skeleton** – basic command parsing and game loop.
2. **Deck & Card System** – data structures and draw/play mechanics.
3. **Encounter Logic** – procedural generation of enemies and rooms.
4. **Basic Victory/Defeat Flow** – run through a short dungeon.

Upcoming tasks involve creating a dedicated package for game logic and wiring it into the monorepo build.
