# Product Context

This repo collects experiments that pair Codex with TypeScript tooling. The roguelike deck‑builder is one such experiment showcasing how **Effect‑TS** can structure a game loop while remaining easy to extend. Players progress through random encounters using a deck of cards. The first version runs in the command line yet remains flexible enough to support a web UI later.

## Problems Solved
- Demonstrates an Effect‑TS approach to stateful game logic
- Provides a sandbox for experimenting with AI‑generated content
- Allows incremental growth from CLI to potential web UI

## User Goals
- Quickly get a feel for deck‑building mechanics
- Explore procedurally generated challenges
- Contribute new cards or encounters with minimal friction
